`msPAF` ssdtools` is an R package to obtained additive toxicity estimates based on 2 or more Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD). 

SSDs are cumulative probability distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for different species as described by Posthuma et al. (2001).
The current versions of msPAF takes SSDs fitted via the `ssdtools` package, which uses Maximum Likelihood to fit distributions such as the gamma, log-logistic, log-normal and Weibull to censored and/or weighted data.

## Installation

To install the latest version of `ssdtools` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssdtools)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ssdtools")
```

To install the latest development version of `msPAF` from [GitHub](https://github.com/open-AIMS/msPAF)

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("open-aims/msPAF", ref = "dev")
```

## Introduction

`ssdtools` accesses examples SSD data from the [ssddata](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssddata) package for a range of chemicals. We will use the Boron and Cadmium datasets here as a two component mixture example.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ssdtools)
ssddata::ccme_boron
ssddata::ccme_cadmium
```

We start by fitting the default `ssdtools` distributions are fit using `ssd_fit_dists()`, to create a named list of `ssdtools` `fitdists` objects for the chemicals for which we want to explore additive toxicity.

```{r}
fits <- list(boron = ssd_fit_dists(ssddata::ccme_boron), 
             cadmium = ssd_fit_dists(ssddata::ccme_cadmium))
             
```

The resulting fitted distributions can be quickly plotted using `autoplot`
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

theme_set(theme_bw())

plot_list <- lapply(fits, FUN = function(p){
  autoplot(p) +
    scale_colour_ssd()  
})

ggarrange(plotlist = plot_list, common.legend = TRUE, labels = names(plot_list))

```
We can obtain predictions of the additive proportion of species affected across both chemicals using

```{r}
library(msPAF)
plot_dat <- additive_predict(fits)
plot_dat
```

For two contaminants, these can be visualized as a surface.

```{r}
library(plotly)
z=plot_dat$additive_proportions
y=plot_dat$boron
x=plot_dat$cadmium
dat <- data.frame(z,y,x)
plot_ly(z = ~xtabs(z ~ x + y), data = dat) |> 
  add_surface() 
```  

The model-averaged additive 1, 5, 10 and 20% hazard concentration can be estimated via `additive_hc`. Note that for two contaminants, these form a curve.

```{r}
hc_vals_out <- additive_hc(fits)
hc_vals_out
```

For only two contaminants, these co-dependence curves can easily be visualized.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hc_vals_out |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=boron, y=cadmium, colour = proportion)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()
```
The model-averaged additive hazard proportion values can be obtained via `additive_hp` by providing the list of fitted SSDs and a named list of concentrations for each contaminant.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hp_vals_out <- additive_hp(fits, 
                           conc = list(boron = c(1, 5, 10), 
                                       cadmium = c(0.1, 0.2)))
hp_vals_out
```



```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
cat(licensing_md())
```
