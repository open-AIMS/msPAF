# msPAF with ssdtools <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

`msPAF` is an R package for predicting additive toxicity effects on species or communities under multiple stressors. Joint toxicity from two or more contaminants and/or stressors is estimated using the Independent Action (Response Addition) model, which calculates the sum of probabilistic risks when the stressors do not interact and have different modes of action (de Zwart and Posthuma 2005 Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 24(10), 2665-2676).

While `ms` originally referred to `multi-substance`, we adopt the broader interpretation of `multi-stressor` as outlined Negri, et al. 2020 (Environmental Science and Technology, 54(2), pp.1102-1110), reflecting the packages applicability to both chemical and non-chemical stressors . The term `PAF` refers to the `Potentially Affected Fraction`, derived from models predicting joint toxicity based on 2 or more Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD). SSDs are cumulative probability distributions fitted to toxicity data across multiple species, as described by Posthuma et al. (2001). Thus `msPAF` estimates the proportion of a community (represented by the SSD) potentially affected by the combined stressors. 

The current versions of msPAF accepts SSDs generated fitted via the `ssdtools` package, which uses Maximum Likelihood to fit distributions such as the gamma, log-logistic, log-normal and Weibull to censored and/or weighted data, and returns a model averaged SSD. 

We have extended the `msPAF` methodology estimate the Potentially Affected Fraction for individual species, calculated as the percentage effect relative to the control under the assumption of additive toxicity. Here, `Fraction` refers to the proportional or percentage effect, analogous to the `x` in an `ECx` estimate. The package currently supports concentration response curves fitted by the package `bayesnec`, which uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to fit a range of non-linear models to concentration response data using Bayesian methods.

```

## Introduction

`ssdtools` accesses examples SSD data from the [ssddata](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssddata) package for a range of chemicals. We will use the Boron and Cadmium datasets here as a two component mixture example.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ssdtools)
ssddata::ccme_boron
ssddata::ccme_cadmium
```

We start by fitting the default `ssdtools` distributions are fit using `ssd_fit_dists()`, to create a named list of `ssdtools` `fitdists` objects for the chemicals for which we want to explore additive toxicity.

```{r}
fits <- list(boron = ssd_fit_dists(ssddata::ccme_boron), 
             cadmium = ssd_fit_dists(ssddata::ccme_cadmium))
             
```

The resulting fitted distributions can be quickly plotted using `autoplot`
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

theme_set(theme_bw())

plot_list <- lapply(fits, FUN = function(p){
  autoplot(p) +
    scale_colour_ssd()  
})

ggarrange(plotlist = plot_list, common.legend = TRUE, labels = names(plot_list))

```
We can obtain predictions of the additive proportion of species affected across both chemicals using

```{r}
library(msPAF)
plot_dat <- additive_predict(fits)
head(plot_dat)
```

For two contaminants, these can be visualized as a surface.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)
z=plot_dat$additive_proportions
y=plot_dat$boron
x=plot_dat$cadmium
dat <- data.frame(z,y,x)
plot_ly(z = ~xtabs(z ~ x + y), data = dat) |> 
  add_surface() 
```  

The model-averaged additive 1, 5, 10 and 20% hazard concentration can be estimated via `additive_hc`. Note that for two contaminants, these form a curve.

```{r}
hc_vals_out <- additive_hc(fits)
hc_vals_out
```

For only two contaminants, these co-dependence curves can easily be visualized.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
hc_vals_out |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=boron, y=cadmium, colour = proportion)) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```
The model-averaged additive hazard proportion values can be obtained via `additive_hp` by providing the list of fitted SSDs and a named list of concentrations for each contaminant.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hp_vals_out <- additive_hp(fits, 
                           fixed_conc = list(boron = c(1, 5, 10), 
                                       cadmium = c(0.1, 0.2)))
hp_vals_out
```
